**SecondFront Data Exercise:**

To accomplish this exercise, I built a COVID-19 information sheet from 3 open source APIs to dig down into how COVID-19 affected different regions and subregions.

https://about-corona.net/documentation - Historical information per Country
https://covidtracking.com/data/api/version-2 - More information specific to the United States
https://fabian7593.github.io/CountryAPI - Information about different Countries including region.
